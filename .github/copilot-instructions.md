# Spoiler Blocker Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension project that hides comments on YouTube videos to prevent spoilers, with an option to show them when desired.

## Project Structure
- `manifest.json`: Contains extension configuration
- `content.js`: Script that runs on YouTube pages
- `images/`: Directory for extension icons

## Future Development Ideas
- Implement user preferences for blocking settings
- Create a popup interface for the extension
- Add customizable keywords for detecting potential spoilers
- Add options to automatically hide or show comments for certain channels
